## Mission Log #284

It was supposed to be a simple round trip mission!  
Launch from Earth, fly to Mars, sling around Mars and fly back home.  
The navigation computers must have gotten confused or maybe the wrong destination was set...  
...or maybe this was intentional??

## Mission Log #285

Finally managed to get my strength together and put Jennifer, Marc and Danny into the airlock.  
Still need to do an EVA to "burry" them somewhere outside.  
Such talented astronauts killed during an unexpected entry into Mars' atmosphere.  
Why was I unharmed? How is this justice?

## Mission Log #286

Luckily the mission was fully equiped and not just a pseudo run.  
The vehicle is fully functional.  
But we... I am soon running out of supplies.

## Mission Log #287

In the distance I can make out some strange land structures.  
If the circumstances were different, this would be the greatest moment in human history...  
Now it's just about survive to maybe tell the stories one day.
